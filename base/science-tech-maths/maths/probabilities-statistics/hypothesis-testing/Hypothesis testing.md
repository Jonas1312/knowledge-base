# Hypothesis testing

- p-value = P(X|H0)
  - too small: we reject H0
  - too big: H0 cannot be rejected
- a Type I error refers to the action of rejecting the null hypothesis, while it actually holds true (it is not-null)
- a Type II error refers to the rejection of the alternative (non-null) hypothesis, while in fact it is true
- making a Type I/II error in a medical setting may not be the same as testing the results of a marketing survey in the fashion industry.
- accepting the hypothesis that a certain drug treatment is effective against cancer when in fact it is not (Type II) error may result in severe consequences vs another scenario (say advertisement) in which the degree of impact of the decisions being made as a result of the analysis is orders of magnitude lower.
