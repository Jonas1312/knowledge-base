# Terminology

- Deconvolution: removing blur from an image.
- Sharpening: improving the perceived acuity and visual sharpness of an image, especially for viewing it on a screen or print.
- Super-resolution: reconstructing missing detail in an image.
- Upsampling: increasing the image resolution, with no relation to blur, sharpness, or detail – but aiming to at least not reduce it. Sadly ML literature calls upsampling “single frame super-resolution”.
